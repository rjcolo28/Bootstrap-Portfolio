          My name is Ryan Colosanti. I am an aspiring game designer currently based in between Richmond, VA and
          Williamsburg, VA. I have always had a passion for video games from the first time I played Pokemon Blue on the
          Gameboy Color. Video games have always been a way for me to relax and escape for a brief period of time. I love
          being a part of the many different worlds and discovering all of their secrets. Now I want to give that same
          feeling adventure and wonder to other people of all walks of life by creating the same video games that make me
          excited to pick up a controller and turn on the console.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, you will find a multitude of projects I have completed in the past six months during a coding boot camp.
          These projects were made with real professional work and in-demand skills in mind. I have also included some
          side projects I have completed going through a self-paced game design program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I chose a path in development, I graduated from the University of Colorado with a Bachelor of Arts in
          History. What draws me to history is the storytelling aspect. I love reading and hearing about all the
          different events that happened, from the fantastic to the mundane. Itâ€™s like hearing a tale from a totally
          different world.
        </p>
        <p>
          When not writing code, I spend my free time playing video games, reading fiction (usually fantasy), or watching
          sports. Outside the house, I enjoy exploring museums and tasting local craft beers.
